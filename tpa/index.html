            What is transfer of property?
            </h3>
            <p>
                According to section 5 of the T.P. Act, transfer of property is an act by which a living person conveys property in present or in future to one or more other living persons or to himself and one or more living persons and ‘to transfer property' is to perform such act.
            </p>
            <p>
                From above definition of transfer of property, we get to analyse the following essential elements of transfer of property:
              </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> It is an act of conveying – Conveying means creating a new title or interest by one person (transferor) in favour of another person (transferee). The word ‘transfer’ is used in wide sense it may be transfer of all interest/rights in the property or only some of it. Further, it may be conditional or absolute. </li>
                </ol>
                <ol start="2">
                    <li> In present or in future – Title/interest in the property may be conveyed immediately or postponed to a future date. Creation of interest in the property is different from vesting of interest in the property. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Transfer of future property – Although the transfer of property may be in present or in future, yet the property must be in existence at the date of transfer. There can be no transfer of future property. The word ‘in present or in future' qualifies the word conveys and not the word ‘property’. It is only that the time of vesting of interest in the property can be decided by parties.
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <ol start="3">
                    <li>Transfer by living person to other living person(s) or to himself – The conveyance of property must be from one living person to another. T.P. Act deals with transfer of property by act of parties and not by operation of law. Living person includes a company or association or body of individuals whether corporated or not. </li>
                    <ul>
                    <li> Transfer by will – Transfer by will do not come within the scope of definition of transfer of property because such transactions comes into effect after the death of the person executing will. However it should be noted that section 13 permits creation of interest by transfer of property in favour of an unborn person. </li>
                    <li> Transfer to himself – Normally, transfer must be done by one person(transferor) to another person(transferee) but if same person has more than one capacity then transfer can be done from one capacity to another. For example – Transfer from capacity of individual to capacity in which the same person is trustee can be effected. </li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li>Property – Property is something which has some economic value. In T.P. Act, it is used in wide sense as follow – </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Tangible material things – eg. Land, houses, furniture, jewellery, ete. </li>
                        <li> Right which are exercised over material things – eg. right to enjoy and posess, right to sell or make gift of things, etc. </li>
                        <li> Right which are not exercised over any material things – eg. a right to repayment of debt. </li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>

            <h3 style="text-align:left">
            Are these transfer of property?
            </h3> 
                <ul>
                    <li> Surrender – Surrender is not a transfer of property within the meaning of section 5 of T.P. Act. In surrender the lesser interest falls into greater interest in such a manner that the greater interest is not enlarged. Eg. when a tenant gives up his right of residence before expiry of the term of tenancy, there is no creation of new title or interest in favour of landlord. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li> Partition – Partition is not a Transfer of property because nothing new is obtained by a co-sharer on partition. After the partition each member gets merely the separate right of enjoyment. No new interest is created in this process. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li> Charge – A charge on property is also not a transfer of property because only a right of payment out of the property subject to charge. It is simply securing ‘personal obligation' out of the property. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li> Relinquishment – Relinquishment (by reversioner of his reversionary interest) does not amount to transfer because it cannotes the extinction of a right and there is nothing left to transfer. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li> Family settlement – It is not Transfer of property because it is not an alienation, only the already existing specific share of member of the family are defined and separated in order to avoid any existing or future dispute. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li> Compromise – It is not Transfer of property. It is an agreement for the settlement of doubtful claims between the parties in respect of some property. Like family settlement, here too the title or interest of the parties are already existing the compromise deed simply defines them. There is no conveyance. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li> Release – Release is a transfer of property. If larger interest falls into a smaller interest in such a way, the smaller interest is enlarged, then for the holder of smaller interest there is creation of a new title or interest. Since some new title or interest are added to his already existing interest, there is conveyance. Hence it amounts to Transfer of property. </li>
                </ul>
            <h3 style="text-align:left">
            What may be transferred?
            </h3> 
                <p>
                    Section 6 of the T.P. Act provides that property of any kind may be transferred except as otherwise provided by this Act or any other law in force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general policy of law for Transfer of property is to promote free alienation and circulation of property. The transferability of property is therefor the general rule and its non-transferability, an exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6 of T.P. Act itself provides for a list of interest which cannot be transferred (apart from other laws in force) :-

                            <ol>
                                <li> Chance of an hair apparent succeeding to an estate – A living person has no hair. Hair apparent is a person who would be hair in future. The heir apparent can succeed only when – </li>

                                <li> He survives the propositus. </li>
                                <li> Propositus dies intestate (i.e. without making will). </li>
                            </ul>
                                <li> Chance of relation obtaining a legacy on the death of kinsman (Chance of legacy) – It means  expectation of getting property under a will. A will operate only after death of lagator and not on date when it is made. The legatee can get property only if –

                <ol start="6">
                    <li> A mere right to sue cannot be transferred. It is a personal right of aggrieved person. If so allowed, it will amount to gambling in litigation. E.g. claim for unliquidated damages in tort or contract. it is different from actionable claim which may be alienated. </li>
