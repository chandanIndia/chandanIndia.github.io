            [Q] Explain Suit of ‘civil nature’ with the help of proper illustrations.
        </h3>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Suit of civil nature is a suit where the object of the suit is determination and enforcement of a civil legal right upon the violation of that right. By using the expression suit of ‘civil nature’, section 9 makes an attempt to give expansive application to the jurisdiction of civil court. The expression ‘civil nature’ is wider then word ‘civil proceeding’. In pure civil proceedings, only the civil legal rights are in issue. But in a suit of ‘civil nature’, some pure religious or social issues are also involved along with some civil legal rights. In such a case, the test is to examine whether the dominant question in the suit relates to the adjudication of civil legal rights or not, if it is, then it will be called a suit of civil nature.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Explanation I to Section 9 makes it abundantly clear that if such civil legal right cannot be decided without deciding the question as to religious rites or ceremonies, the court has power to determine these questions in order to determine principle question.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        A suit involving the principle question of caste/religion, or for upholding mere dignity/honour is not a suit of civil nature.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p align="justify">
                    When a person has been outcaste, evicted from his house and is denied all means of livelihood; and the he person files suit for restoration of right to life and restoration into the cast. Here, the expulsion involves the violation of civil legal rights or fundamental rights, it amount to a suit of civil nature even though in that suit the remedy for restoration of caste may not be granted.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p align="justify">
                            However if the suit was only for restoration of the cast, then it is nor a civil suit, neither a suit of civil nature. Here, no civil legal right is involved but only a pure social issue. Therefore the civil court will not have jurisdiction.
