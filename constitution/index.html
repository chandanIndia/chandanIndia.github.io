    <h3 style="text-align:left"> Freedom of religion and conscience </h3>
    <p align="justify"> India is a secular country which means that state has no official religion and it has to maintain neutrality in matters of religion and provide equal protection to all religion without any favour or discrimination. A secular state is founded on the idea that state is concerned with social relations between man and man and not with relations between man and God which is a matter of personal faith. The policy of state in pure secularism is to protect all religions but it interferes with none. </p>
    <p align="justify"> The Indian constitution embodied the concept of secularism from the very inception through fundamental rights and directive principles of State policy. Later in 1976 the word 'secular' has been added to the preamble to make it express. Further, to underline the great significance of secularism, the supreme court in the case of S.R. Bomai v. Union of India (1994 - 9 Judges bench) declared it as 'basic' feature of the constitution. </p>
    <p align="justify"> <b>Nature of Indian secularism </b> </p>
    <p align="justify"> Secularism as practised in India is fundamentally different from Western secularism which developed out of Church-State separation and individual liberty. Indian secularism is much older and derived from philosophical concept of of 'Sarva Dharm Sambhava' which seeks to achieve peaceful co-existence of different religions. So, secularism in Indian context would not mean in the state remaining away from religion; instead it would mean maintaining equal distance from all religion and giving equal respect and protection to all. </p>
    <p align="justify"> The Indian constitution has allowed extensive interference of the state in religious affairs; for example - modification of Hindu personal laws, recognition of sharia based Muslim personal laws, taking over the management of Hindu temples, financial assistance to religious schools, opening up of Hindu temple to people of lower caste etc. Thus the concept of secularism in India is not merely of passive attitude of religious tolerance but a positive concept of giving equal respect and protection to each religion. It has been referred to as positive secularism. </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:left"> Constitutional provisions relating to to right of religion </h3>
    <p align="justify"> The Indian constitution confers rights relating to freedom of religion to all persons in India and not just citizens. These provisions guarantees freedom to both individuals and religious groups. </p>
    <ol start="1"> <b>
            <li> Freedom of conscience and free profession practice and propagation of religion (Article 25):
        </b>
        <p align="justify"> Article 25(1) guarantees to all persons in India, the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, health, morality and other fundamental rights. </p>
        <p align="justify"> What is religion - Religion is essentially a matter of personal faith and belief. In P.M.A. Metropolitan v. Moran Mar Morthoma(1995), supreme court observed that religion is the belief which binds spiritual nature of man two supernatural being. it lays down code of ethical rules rituals ceremonies and modes of worship as integral part of the religion to be followed by its followers. It might even extend to matters of food and dress. </p>
        <p align="justify"> The freedom of conscience in article 25 (1) means the right to follow one's belief in matters of religion and morality. It is a broad right supporting an individual to make his own decisions; weather of being religious in his own way or not being so at all, based on his personal deeply held beliefs. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left"> Article 25 (1) confess on all persons the right to freely:- </p>
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <p align="justify"> <b>
                  Profess
                </b> i.e. to declare freely and openly one's faith and beliefs in any manner. Explanation I to Article 25 provides that the wearing and carrying of Kirpans shall be deemed to included in the profession of Sikh religion. </p>
            </li>
                <li>
                    <p align="justify"> <b>Practice
            </b> i.e. to perform the prescribed religious duties, rites and rituals. Such practice should be regarded by the religion as its essential and integral part. </p>
            </li>
                <li>
                    <p align="justify"> <b>Propagate
            </b> i.e. to spread and publicize one's religious views for the enlightenment of others. In case of Stanislaus v. state of MP, the supreme court held that the right to to propagate one's religion does not give a right to convert another person to one's own religion as that would impinge on others freedom of conscience. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="text-align:left"> Essential Religious Practice (ERP ) Test </h3>
    <p align="justify"> Over the years, the supreme court has evolved Essential Religious Practices (ERP) test to determine what practices can be constitutionally protected and what can be ignored. in order to be treated as part of religious practices search practice should be regarded by the religion as its essential and integral part. What really constitutes an essential part of religious practice has to be decided by the courts with reference to the doctrine of particular religion including practices regarded as part of its religion. The above mentioned prepositions have been laid down in various cases including The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowment, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt (1954 - 7 Judges bench) and Seshammal v. State of T.N. (1972 - 5 Judges bench). </p>
    <p align="justify"> In the criticism of the test scholars agree that it is better for court to determine what religious practices are permitted by the constitution rather than to determine what is essential to a religion. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"> <b> Keeping Beard </b> </p>
    <p align="justify"> In Mohammed Zubir v. U.O.I. (2016), a 3 judges bench of supreme court upheld the discharge of a Muslim airman from the Indian Air force for keeping beard in violation of Armed Force Regulations, 1964. The court held that keeping beard is not an essential part of Islamic practices. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"> <b> Hizab </b> </p>
    <p align="justify"> In Amna Bint Basheer v. C.B.S.E. (2016), C.B.S.E. had prescribed address code for appearing in AIIMS exams to ensure fair examination process. The Kerala High court held that the practice of wearing a hijab constitutes an essential religious practice. However the court did not quashed the CBSE rule but allowed additional measures for checking students who intend to wear a dress according to their religious custom and contrary to dress code. </p>
    <p align="justify"> However, on the issue of uniform prescribed by school the Kerala High court in Fatima Tasneem vs State of Kerala (2018), held that collective rights of an institution would be given primacy over individual rights of the petitioner. The court kept itself away from directing the private institution to permit Muslim girls to wear hijab. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"> <b> Cow sacrifice </b> </p>
    <p align="justify"> In Mohammed Hanif Qureshi v. State of Bihar (2002), the supreme court held that cow sacrifice is not an obligatory act for a Muslim to exhibit his religious beliefs and ideas on Bakra Eid day. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"> <b> Tandav Dance </b> </p>
    <p align="justify"> In Commissioner of Police v. Acharya J. Avadhuta (2004), the supreme court held that Anand Marga sect has no fundamental right to perform tandav dance in public Street since it did not constitute an essential religious practice of the sect. </p>
