                He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much; <br><br>
                Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;<br><br>
                Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task; <br><br>
                Who has left the world better than he found it, Whether by an improved poppy, a perfect poem or a rescued soul; <br><br>
                Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it; <br>
                Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;<br>
                Who has earned the appreciation of honest critics and endured the betrayal of false friends; <br><br>
                Whose life is an inspiration; <br>
                Whose memory a benediction.
